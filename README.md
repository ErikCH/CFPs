## Create A Login System in Minutes with Amplify Authenticator
### An Auth Library Made Easy for Vue


**Abstract**

There is a lot that goes into building a modern login system: accessibility, user authentication and authorization, forgot your password pages, one time passwords, security and more! The Amplify Authenticator library allows users to create and deploy a fully featured auth flow in minutes, which greatly decreases the complexity of full stack development.


**Description**

In this presentation I'll discuss the new Amplify Authenticator created by me and  my team at AWS. This library was written specifically for Vue, however is also available for React and Angular. It allows front-end developers to effortlessly add authentication flows to their applications. 

Within just a few minutes users can add a log in, log out, and forgot password page, all backed by AWS Cognito, to their apps. In addition, we'll discuss some advanced use cases, including multi-factor authentication, one-time password, and federated logins.

Roadmap:

* Introduction to Amplify
* What is Auth and best practices
* Set up the library and tooling
* Add it in your Vue app
* Demo: Logging in, changing passwords
* Advanced use cases - Federated Login, OTP
* Extend with other amplify services - Admin UI
